# Final

## Brief
For the final your are free to choose what you'd like to do. The project should be a creative use of machine learning. It should be more ambitious in scope compared to what we've done so far this semester. You could do any number of things. A few sample ideas are:
* Build upon and fully complete one of your projects from earlier in the semester
* Create an interactive classification app or game [(example)](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ai/emoji-scavenger)
* Create a physical comic book using style transfer
* Create an interactive dance performance
* Generate a musical composition or an EP of songs
* Create a music/sound generation tool
* Create a twitter bot (a variation could be a bot that learns and grows from people's responses)
* Print out a series of AI enabled art
* Create an interactive application (tool/game/art piece) of char-rnn like text generation 
* Create an art piece that illustrates/amplifies characteristics of this technology (could be illuminating or comedic or both)
* Train an LSTM on SVG data and output new SVGs

The list could go on and on. The above should be considered far from exhaustive.

You may work within a group or by yourself. 

## Grading Rubric
* 25% Creative Thinking: The project should not be just reproducing things using the tools we've looked at. It should have some novel implementation or approach in the application of the tech. Depending on the project, this could include indication of development of personal style/taste (if art project for example), and/or imaginative implementations of the tech in exploring ideas. 
* 25% Production Quality: The project needs to be well polished, with considerable work put into the finished work.
* 25% Clear Conceptual Underpinning: The project needs to be well thought out, and have a clear concept that you are working with from start to finish.
* 18% Machine Learning Application: The project should use and benefit from machine learning.
* 7% Press: The project execution and documentation should be at a level that you feel comfortable submitting it to a press outlet. This last 7% will be for those who actually submit their project to one or more press outlets. The outlet doesn't have to cover your project, you just need to have sent it in.


## Schedule

## Repo
Project Proposal
* Project Theme: Deeper Emoticon
* Background
**As many people in the world using Emojis to express their feeling, Emoticon (顔文字) is widly used in Eastern Asian countries   where the language is based on logogram. Unlike phonogram languages, where the most characters are shown in keyboard of computer or      mobilephones, logogram based languages usually need Input Method Editor programs or apps to type. These programs or apps preserve the space for Emoticons as well as bring more unsusal characters for people to create more Emoticon. Distinguished from Emoji, Emoticons are not icons but the combination of different special text characters. Also, compared to Emoji's ono-to-one relationship between word and emoji icon, Emoticon have varying expression combined by diffrent characters to express similar meanings. In this regard, the expression of emoticon is more vague than emoji, where similar emoticons can reflect different content of user's emotion. Inspired by MIT's Deepmoji program, I am interested to use AI to explore the sentimental relationship between text and emoticons.
